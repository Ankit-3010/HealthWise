# HealthWise

HealthWise is a healthcare-oriented web application aimed at helping users monitor and manage their health efficiently. It combines a user-friendly frontend interface with a robust backend to provide tools such as health tracking, information lookup, and more.
An end-to-end Machine Learning solution with a web-based interface for **the early prediction of diabetes**, using medical and lifestyle data.
 The system is designed to:
- Predict whether a person is diabetic
- Provide a percentage-based risk score for non-diabetic users
Built with a robust ML model achieving **76.5% accuracy**, and integrated into a user-friendly web application.
